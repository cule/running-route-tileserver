Tutorial for creating a tileserver from GPS running routes
==========================================================

Nautilytics was recently approached by WalkJogRun, one of the leaders in iOS GPS running applications, to create a visualization of the most popular public running routes in their global network.
Nautilytics didnâ€™t want to simply create pieces of art from the three plus years of running routes;
we wanted to make the routes as dynamic as possible by creating overlays to add the popular routes on top of a Google Map.
The result of the project was to give users of the application a better understanding of where people were running and where they may want to run in a new city.
In theory, if many runners are running the same route then it may be safer, more scenic, and less polluted.
